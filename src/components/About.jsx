        News is information about current events. This may be provided through
          many different media: word of mouth, printing, postal systems,
          broadcasting, electronic communication, or through the testimony of
          observers and witnesses to events. News is sometimes called "hard
          news" to differentiate it from soft media. Common topics for news
          reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the
          environment, economy, business, fashion, entertainment, and sport, as
          well as quirky or unusual events. Government proclamations, concerning
          royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been
          dubbed news since ancient times. Technological and social
          developments, often driven by government communication and espionage
          networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well
          as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is
          closely associated with the newspaper. Folk news Evidence suggests
          that cultures around the world have found a place for people to share
          stories about interesting new information. Among Zulus, Mongolians,
          Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented
          the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of
          priority.[29] Sufficiently important news would be repeated quickly
          and often, and could spread by word of mouth over a large geographic
          area.[30] Even as printing presses came into use in Europe, news for
          the general public often travelled orally via monks, travelers, town
          criers, etc.[31] The news is also transmitted in public gathering
          places, such as the Greek forum and the Roman baths. Starting in
          England, coffeehouses served as important sites for the spread of
          news, even after telecommunications became widely available. The
          history of the coffee houses is traced from Arab countries, which was
          introduced in England in the 16th century.[32] In the Muslim world,
          people have gathered and exchanged news at mosques and other social
          places. Travelers on pilgrimages to Mecca traditionally stay at
          caravanserais, roadside inns, along the way, and these places have
          naturally served as hubs for gaining news of the world.[33] In late
          medieval Britain, reports ("tidings") of major events were a topic of
          great public interest, as chronicled in Chaucer's 1380 The House of
          Fame and other works.[34] Government proclamations Woodcut by Tommaso
          Garzoni depicting a town crier with a trumpet Before the invention of
          newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins
          and edicts were circulated at times in some centralized empires.[35]
          The first documented use of an organized courier service for the
          diffusion of written documents is in Egypt, where Pharaohs used
          couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the
          State (2400 BC).[36] Julius Caesar regularly publicized his heroic
          deeds in Gaul, and upon becoming dictator of Rome began publishing
          government announcements called Acta Diurna. These were carved in
          metal or stone and posted in public places.[37][38] In medieval
          England, parliamentary declarations were delivered to sheriffs for
          public display and reading at the market.[39] Specially sanctioned
          messengers have been recognized in Vietnamese culture, among the Khasi
          people in India, and in the Fox and Winnebago cultures of the American
          midwest. The Zulu Kingdom used runners to quickly disseminate news. In
          West Africa, news can be spread by griots. In most cases, the official
          spreaders of news have been closely aligned with holders of political
          power.[40] Town criers were a common means of conveying information to
          citydwellers. In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as
          banditori arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news,
          to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307
          and 1322–1325, laws were established governing their appointment,
          conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro
          was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were
          to read them.[41] Different declarations sometimes came with
          additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to
          be read at the city gates.[42] These proclamations all used a standard
          format, beginning with an exordium—"The worshipful and most esteemed
          gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence
          make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of
          whatever status, rank, quality and condition"—and continuing with a
          statement (narratio), a request made upon the listeners (petitio), and
          the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply
          (peroratio).[43] In addition to major declarations, bandi
          (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information,
          and notices about missing slaves.[44] Niccolò Machiavelli was captured
          by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate
          surrender.[45] Some town criers could be paid to include advertising
          along with news.[46] Under the Ottoman Empire, official messages were
          regularly distributed at mosques, by traveling holy men, and by
          secular criers. These criers were sent to read official announcements
          in marketplaces, highways, and other well-traveled places, sometimes
          issuing commands and penalties for disobedience.[47] Early news
          networks The spread of news has always been linked to the
          communications networks in place to disseminate it. Thus, political,
          religious, and commercial interests have historically controlled,
          expanded, and monitored communications channels by which news could
          spread. Postal services have long been closely entwined with the
          maintenance of political power in a large area.[48][49] One of the
          imperial communication channels, called the "Royal Road" traversed the
          Assyrian Empire and served as a key source of its power.[50] The Roman
          Empire maintained a vast network of roads, known as cursus publicus,
          for similar purposes.[51] Visible chains of long-distance signaling,
          known as optical telegraphy, have also been used throughout history to
          convey limited types of information. These can have ranged from smoke
          and fire signals to advanced systems using semaphore codes and
          telescopes.[52][53] The latter form of optical telegraph came into use
          in Japan, Britain, France, and Germany from the 1790s through the
          1850s.[54][55] Asia Reproduction of Kaiyuan Za Bao court newspaper
          from the Tang dynasty The world's first written news may have
          originated in eighth century BCE China, where reports gathered by
          officials were eventually compiled as the Spring and Autumn Annals.
          The annals, whose compilation is attributed to Confucius, were
          available to a sizeable reading public and dealt with common news
          themes—though they straddle the line between news and history.[56] The
          Han dynasty is credited with developing one of the most effective
          imperial surveillance and communications networks in the ancient
          world.[57] Government-produced news sheets, called tipao, circulated
          among court officials during the late Han dynasty (second and third
          centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the Kaiyuan Za Bao ("Bulletin of
          the Court") of the Chinese Tang Dynasty published government news; it
          was handwritten on silk and read by government officials.[58] The
          court created a Bureau of Official Reports (Jin Zhouyuan) to
          centralize news distribution for the court.[59] Newsletters called
          ch'ao pao continued to be produced and gained wider public circulation
          in the following centuries.[60] In 1582 there was the first reference
          to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late Ming
          Dynasty.[61][62] Japan had effective communications and postal
          delivery networks at several points in its history, first in 646 with
          the Taika Reform and again during the Kamakura period from 1183 to
          1333. The system depended on hikyaku, runners, and regularly spaced
          relay stations. By this method, news could travel between Kyoto and
          Kamakura in 5–7 days. Special horse-mounted messengers could move
          information at the speed of 170 kilometers per day.[55][63] The
          Japanese shogunates were less tolerant than the Chinese government of
          news circulation.[58] The postal system established during the Edo
          period was even more effective, with average speeds of 125–150 km/day
          and express speed of 200 km/day. This system was initially used only
          by the government, taking private communications only at exorbitant
          prices. Private services emerged and in 1668 established their own
          nakama (guild). They became even faster, and created an effective
          optical telegraphy system using flags by day and lanterns and mirrors
          by night.[55]
